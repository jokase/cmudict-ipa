cmudict-ipa
===========

CMU pronunciation dictionary in IPA instead of their subset of Arpabet. 

You can use alter the map file and run it through the main.php script to generate your own dictionary. 

It should work on other text files as well, but haven't tried that yet (for example, if you want to try reading something from [Project Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) in your script).
