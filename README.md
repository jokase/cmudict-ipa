===========

CMU pronunciation dictionary in IPA instead of their subset of Arpabet. 

You can alter the map file and run it through the main.php script to generate your own dictionary. 

It should work on other text files as well, but haven't tried that yet (for example, if you want to try reading something from [Project Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) in your script). 

Included is Mark Twain's idea:

## A Plan for the Improvement of Spelling in the English Language
* A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling by Mark Twain
* For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped to be replased either by "k" or "s", and likewise "x" would no longer be part of the alphabet.
* The only kase in which "c" would be retained would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with later.
* Year 2 might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish "y" replasing it with "i" and iear 4 might fiks the "g/j" anomali wonse and for all.
* Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants.
* Bai iear 15 or sou, it wud fainali bi posibl tu meik ius ov thi ridandant letez "c", "y" and "x" -- bai now jast a memori in the maindz ov ould doderez -- tu riplais "ch", "sh", and "th" rispektivli.
